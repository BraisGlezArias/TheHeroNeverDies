# QA - Guide

Thank you for playing and testing "The Hero NEVER Dies", the ground-breaking Boss Survivor Indie Videogame where you Become the Final Boss, please try the answer the following questions while you QA the game:

1. Was the game fun? What would you change to make it more enjoyable?

2. How many times did you play it? Did you find the game too repetitive?

3. Did you experiment any bugs with the collisions between the Player Character and the Enemy? Please try to be the most specific possible if so.

4. What did you think of the narrative? Was it enough, too much or did you want to know more about it?

5. Would you want to be able to play more modes? I will be grateful of any ideas you have in that regard.

That would be all! Please, create an issue where you answer this questions.   
Anything out of it would need to have their own issues.  
Thank you again for testing The Hero NEVER Dies!
