# Marketing

The marketing campaign will consist on three phases on three different social networks:

1. Pre-launch: We will use a twitter account to promote the game.
2. Launch: We will publish a launch trailer on Youtube and the build of the game on Itch.io.
3. Post-launch: We will analize how succesfull the campaign was studying the analytics of the different networks and continue to promote the game for a few days.

**Planning**: We would make some posts for a week with the objective of building anticipation and making more people aware of the inminent release of the game. Once the game is released, we will track the hashtag #TheHeroNEVERDies, which marks tweets made by players who decided to share their score. This way we could measure the impact of our game in this social network.

**Tweets**:

2.  Introducing the Evil Wizard. Once a Hero himself, now he storms the King's Castle looking for vengeance. In his way, the Hero comes to stop him.

    The Evil Wizard is a powerful mage that can conjure deadly Fire and Lightning at will, but will it be enought to kill the Hero?

3.  Introducing the Hero. A masterful swordman who can block any kind of magic with his sacred shield while he vanquish darkness. 

    Even if he seems weak he has a secret: anytime he dies he comes back to live stronger. Can the Hero really NEVER die?

**Planning**: We will publish 3 builds on itch.io (web, Windowsx64 and Windowsx32). The most probable outcome it's that the web version would be the most played one, but adding desktops versions we make sure people who can't play on browser have an alternative. This way we will maximize the number of players.
