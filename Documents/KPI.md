# KPI

We have decided to evaluate the success of our game estimating the number of players that it had after release. For this endeavor we will take the number of downloads and the number of times the game was played on a browser. While it's highly probable that one person would only download the game once, we can't apply the same thinking to browser plays. We would assume that while most people would only play the game once, there would be a few that would do it multiple times, and so, we decided that the average number of plays per player would probably be almost twice. With this in mind, we would take half the browser plays as players and sum them to the downloads. Now we have an estimate of 59 individual players. We shall consider this a success since it's probable that our estimations are lower than they should.

> (90 / 2) + 14 = 59

If we wanted to embark on wishful thinking and assume that this would mean 59 sold copys if the game was a paid one, the success would be even greater, as this is the first game published by a lonely developer. In the analysis of costs, we calculated that with minimun wage (5 €/h) and 35 hours of work for this game, we have expent over 175 € developing the game. A game this short should have a prize equal to or less than 5 €, so we calculated that if the game sells for 3 €/unit, with 58 units sold it would be enough. With all this data we can assure that in this hypothetical situation, we will already be past the point of equilibrium and now we will receive only benefits. Of course, this is all speculation, as free games are usually more played due to them being free, but it's a nice mental exercise to do.
