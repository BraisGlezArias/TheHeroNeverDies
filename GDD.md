# The Hero Never Dies

## Introducción y Vision General

The Hero Never Dies is an small independent game with the simple premise of being the Final Boss for once, giving the players the experience of controlling a being with great power, but at the same testing their patience as the titular Hero just seemingly don't die, no matter how many times you kill him. The game itself it's gonna be made by a lonely individual with the videogame motor Unity, making use of free assets from the Unity Asset Store.

## Descripción del Juego

In The Hero Never Dies, for once, instead of being the Hero, the players take the role of the Dark Wizard trying to kill him, but this is not easy task, since the hero, as the title foreshadows, never seems to die. Therefore, the game's main goal is killing over and over this pesky Hero who refuse to die until it's the Dark Wizard who meets his demise, making it somehow akin to a war of attrition.

## Mecánicas de Juego

The players, as the Dark Wizard, will be able to have free movement in the small space where the epic battle takes place: moving left or right and jumping. At the same time, they will have access to two spells to try to kill the hero: a fire one with little range, and a thunder one that will be able to damage the Hero from a safe distance. This spells will drain a magic bar that will replenish itself with the time, so the players will need to think well when to use their spells. The players will also have a health bar that will be reduced when they take damage from the Hero; everytime they kill the hero, this bar will be fully replenished. Once the players lost all their health, the game ends and their final score its the number of times they killed the hero.

## Personajes y Enemigos

There are only two characters in The Hero Never Dies: the Dark Wizard and the Hero. In a subversion of traditional videogame roles, the player controls the former and the latter is the only enemy you batlle in the game, althought you will do it over and over again.

### Dark Wizard

The Dark Wizard is a powerful sorcerer who once upon a time was a hero himself, but tired of not being recognized for his efforts, he decided to walk the path of evil and is now in a quest to conquer the Kingdom the Hero hails from. Now, the titular Hero stands before him, being the last obstacle between him and his victory.

### Hero

The Hero is a fearsome warrior recognized in all the Kingdom for his courage and strength. Now that the Evil Wizard is attacking the Kingdom, the King is counting with him to be the last line of defense and twarth the plans of the Evil Wizard.

## Niveles y Mapas

There is only one map or level in the game: that being the castle where the epic final battle between the Hero and the Dark Wizard takes place. Both can only move horizontally or jump vertically and there will be invisible walls that will help avoid that the characters move out of camera so the players can know their positions at any time.

## Sistema de Progresión

The Progression System is the opposite at what you would expect: instead of the player's character becoming stronger, it's the enemy character the one who will be leveling up everytime he dies, while the player will start feeling almighty and powerful, but will have the sensation of becoming weaker as the game progresses, while the truth is that his stats will be always the same.

## Arte y Diseño Visual

Even when for the artistic aspects of the game we will be using free assets from the Unity Assets Store, they have been selected with the idea of bringing to the game an aesthetic of medieval fantasy. While the characters are in 2D, the environment is in 3D, giving the game a feeling of visual deep while the gameplay is fully bidimensional.

## Sonido y Música

Like the art, the music of the game consists entirely of free assets from the Unity Assets Store. Like the art, this assets have been selected with the medieval fantasy aesthetic in mind. While the tracks selected for the main menu and the credits will be more soothing and relaxing, the ones for the gameplay will be befitting of a final boss, giving excitement to the players.

## Narrativa

Once upon a time, there was a powerful hero in a distant Kingdom whose magic was par to none. The hero was loved by everyone and was happy to help with everything he could. Eventually, the people of the kingdom started to depent on him even for the most menial tasks and the hero started to grow tired and disappointed. When the King decided to use him for political gain, the hero had enough and deserted the Kingdom. This is when he decided to walk the path of dark magic.

Years later, the hero became the powerful Dark Wizard, who managed to create an army of monsters and demons. With this military power, he decided to conquer the Kingdom that wronged him. Nonetheless, the Kingdom has a new Hero now, a new pawn for the King to use and for the people to abuse. Even if the Dark Wizard empathize with his successor, he is not going to let anyone to stand between him and his vengeance.

## Economía del juego

There will be not an economy of any kind inside the game. Even if the players manage to kill the Hero multiple times, they would not receive experience or money for it. They will have to survive the most time possible with the abilities they have at their disposal since the beginning.

## Pruebas y Equilibrio

We will realize two kinds of test so we will be sure our game works as it should be:

1. Balance Testing: We will test that the game is not too difficult or too easy. In our case, that would mean that the players should be able to be alive without problems for 5 rounds at least, but once they reach the 10th, it would become specially difficult to survive.

2. Error Testing: We must be sure that there will be no major glitchs or bugs in our game: the controls work as expected, the characters interact without problems and the key events are triggered when they shall do it.

## Plataformas y Tecnología

The game will be released for PCs with any of the following operative systems: Windows, Linux or Mac. A release for mobile devices with Operative Systems like Android or iOS will be considered. The game will be made using the videogame motor Unity3D.

## Cronograma y Desarrollo

*A timeline of the development will be inserted here later*

## Marketing y Promoción

We will create a X (formerly known as Twitter) account to promote the game once its development is done. The developer will be the Community Manager and will post information about the game for several days before the release. We will create at least one trailer that will be updated to YouTube and shared in our social networks to promote the game. We will be also requesting feedback from people who looks up to the game, and if enought interest is gathered, we will promise to update and work more on it after release.
